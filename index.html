        <h3>Self Introduction</h3>

        <p>  Hi, I'm Fritz Jenner J. Vitto from Bangbang, Gasan, Marinduque and currently studying at Marinduque State College taking the course of Bachelors of Science in Information Technology.
           I am encouraged to pursue this course as my first choice of career, I do have experience in the field of technology since my hobby is editing, computer programming and reading books about computer.
           I’ve created this website—so you can see my work so far and get a sense of who I am as a writer.

        <h3>Background on Information Technology</h3>
        <p>I am currently a third year college on Information Techonology, learning the programming language of PHP, XML, HTML, and CSS. I have also worked on several projects during my time at second year, including the subject of networking which is about different types of network devices and its structures. These experiences have not only reinforced my academic learnings but also broadened my knowledge and perspective towards the technologies.</p>
